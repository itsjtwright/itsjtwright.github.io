        <h2>A Hub for JT Wright's Work</h2>
        <p>The internet is a goofy place. Busy, moving, bustling, exciting. I've been apart of it for a while now.
            As a college student in 2018, this place is something I have grown up with, and over time learned to how to mold it.
            As time moves forward, I realized that I want to focus my life on building communities with the tools at my disposal.
            So think of this site as a bag for those communities (and also all the other junk I make).
